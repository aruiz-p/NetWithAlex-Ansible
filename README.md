## Ansible Study Notes

This is complementary material for the study notes created in this <a href="www.netwhithalex.blog"> post </a>

### Built With

* [![Ansible][Ansible.io]][Ansible-url]
* [![Jinja][Jinja.io]][Jinja-url]

### Prerequisites

It is recommended to have a virtualized environment to emulate network devices and ansible server node.  

I used [GNS3](https://www.gns3.com/) running on my local machine

From the marketplace you can look for the following appliances and import them to your GNS3 server:
* Cisco IOU L3
* Cisco IOU L2
* Network Automation

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aruiz-p/repo_name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
